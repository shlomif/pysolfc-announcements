## New stable release of PySolFC — an open-source collection of over 1,000 card Solitaire/Mahjong games

[PySolFC](http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/) is a free and open-source collection of over 1,000 card Solitaire and Mahjong games with many features and solver/analysis tools. It is almost [20 years old](http://solitaire.vegard2.net/pysol.html]), and the current development efforts are concentrated on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC).

The PySolFC developers are happy to announce a new stable release, 2.2.0, of PySolFC (the last one was in distant 2009!). Among the new features are:

* Compatibility with both Python 3.x and Python 2.7.
* UI Support for the Kivy toolkit for Android devices and other systems.
* A Microsoft Windows binary installer.
* Support for dealing all [Freecell Pro deals](http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/faq.html#what_are_ms_deals) by specifying "ms100000", or similar, as the seed.
* Support for the [Black Hole and All in a Row solver](http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/black-hole-solitaire-solver/) was added.
* Test suite and [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) have been added to the repository.
* The code now passes [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) validation.

You can find [download links](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pysolfc/files/PySolFC/) for current Windows, source, and Android versions.

Future plans:

* Vector-based fully scalable cards and graphics
* Large-scale cardsets for HD displays
* Bug fixes and cleanups.
* An online, WWW-based version.

If you want to help, we need:

* Programmers
* Graphic designers who would help with improving the app’s look
* People to help with documentation and translations
* People who would spread the word
* Testers / QA people

We will gladly answer any questions!
