## New stable release of PySolFC — an open-source collection of over 1,000 card Solitaire/Mahjong games

[PySolFC](https://pysolfc.sourceforge.io/) is a free and open-source collection of over 1,000 card Solitaire and Mahjong games with many features and solver/analysis tools. It is more than [20 years old](http://solitaire.vegard2.net/pysol.html), and the current development efforts are concentrated on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC).

The PySolFC developers are happy to announce a new stable release, 2.10.0, of PySolFC. Among the new features are:

* Fix the moves for Scorpion Tail.
* Pause the game while displaying the statistics dialog
* Run the solvers using DLL calls and [cffi](https://pypi.org/project/cffi/) for an improved speed.

You can find [download links](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pysolfc/files/PySolFC/) for current Windows, source code, and Android versions.
Packages for Linux/BSD/etc. distributions and operating systems should be made
available soon from the downstream packagers.

Future plans:

* Vector-based fully scalable cards and graphics
* Large-scale cardsets for HD displays
* An online, WWW-based version

If you want to help, we need:

* Programmers
* Graphic designers who would help with improving the app’s look
* People to help with documentation and translations
* People who would spread the word
* Testers / QA people
* Monetary donations - see [this page](http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/how-to-help/)

We will gladly answer any questions!

Remember that apart from this thread you can also contact us using the [FOSS Card Games group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/foss-card-games), and using the ##pysol chat room on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (note the double octothorpe/hash-sign/pound-sign).

A final note is that while we are using GitHub for version control, and accept
pull requests and issue reports, we are still hosting the main site and the
downloads on SourceForge.net. See [the explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8237i3/help_is_needed_in_preparing_a_windows_binary/dv84xxu/)
